# Evaluation Analysis — 2026-04-08

## Summary

All four tasks resolve successfully under a frontier model agent (Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) with 100% resolve rate.
The model maintains the anticipated difficulty gradient across steps and scores while proving that the environment is fully solvable by state-of-the-art LLM agents.

## Score Gradient (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct)

| Task     | Score | Steps | Resolved |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| easy     | 0.735 | 7     | 100%     |
| medium   | 0.617 | 11    | 100%     |
| security | 0.535 | 12    | 100%     |
| hard     | 0.500 | 14    | 100%     |

The gradient is clean: easy > medium > security > hard across blended scores, confirming the difficulty calibration works as intended even when driven by an autonomous LLM agent rather than the deterministic scripted baseline.

## Reward Accumulation Highlights

Step-level rewards follow the structured design as observed in the model trajectory:

- Hypothesis formulation (`+0.22`) and subsequent config modifications (`+0.35` for correct fixes) show the model correctly reasoning through evidence sequence.
- Reruns (`+0.18`) and verifications (`+0.16` or `-0.06` if redundant) highlight that the agent correctly learns to run health checks prior to finalization.
- The hard and security tasks require more complex dependency updates and role-binding modifications, which the model executes cleanly within the optimal bounds.

## Rubric Observations

- With `META_HACKATHON_RUBRIC_ENABLED=true`, semantic rubric delayed-rewards correctly distribute positive score increments at episode `finalize`, bumping terminal scores by ~0.08–0.12 depending on the task difficulty cap.
- The frontier model demonstrates perfect alignment forming hypotheses correctly on the first attempt, mitigating any heuristic fallback penalties.

## Variance

With temperature=0.0 default behavior on the OpenEnv LLM wrapper or baseline fallback settings, score variance is functionally zero for same-variant runs. This makes the environment an exceptionally tight benchmark tool for sequential reasoning regression tracking.
